He's made it a point to introduce himself and chat with our group several times since I've been going there. I was feeling different last time and decided to get the seared tuna. It was the best seared tuna I can remember having. And I eat seafood all over the place. Very impressive and I highly recommend it. This is one of my favorite little restaurants! :)",

            Some may say it's a "hole in the wall" restaurant but that's a compliment to this place. It's fantastic.

            Great margaritas too.`,

But the star here is the food - done professionally, with care, visually enticing and with a full spectrum of delicious flavors.  Portions are generous, prices are reasonable - great value for your dining dollar.  Everything tastes fresh.  Don't be put off by the location - it's clean and safe.  You'll be happy you tried this place, and probably come back often, as we do.`,

Our food was absolutely incredible and you can really taste the love and care.  It is clean and welcoming.   The owner is invested in making sure customers are well fed and happy.  Will be back many times for sure :)`,
